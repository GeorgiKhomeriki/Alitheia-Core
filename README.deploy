To run the deploy target against the SQO-OSS maven repository, we use 
the webdav maven transport wagon over ssl. However, since the certificate
we use is self signed, the JSSL library underlying the HTTP library that
the webdav component uses, needs to be configured with a trust store. In
short, this involves 4 steps:

1. Get the required certificates

Maven repository certificate: You can find the certificate under misc/repo.crt.
You can also get a fresh copy in case the certificate changes directly from the
web server.

2. Create the truststore

keytool -v -alias mavensrv -import -file misc/maven.crt -keystore maven.jks

3. Configure maven to use it by default

export MAVEN_OPTS="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=maven.jks
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=XXXXXX -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=maven.jks
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStoreType=jks -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=XXXXXX"

Replace XXXXX with the password you used to create the truststore above.

4. Tell maven about your login credentials to the webdav server

To do so, you need to edit the ~/.m2/settings.xml file and add the server. The
file should look like this after editing it

<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>ac-main</id>
      <username>YOUR-SQOOSS-USERNAME</username>
      <password>YOUR-SQOOSS-PASSWORD</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
