    <h1>Definition Groups Can't Have Users</h1>

    <p>The system allows to create groups and users, but it has a special type of groups, called "definition groups".
    They're used to partly define the security policy, but they don't accept to have users. Those groups should always
    be empty.</p>
    
    <div class="example">

        <h3>Example</h3>

        <p>At startup, the system has a group named <span concordion:set="#group">web services service security group</span>.
        This group is a <span concordion:assertEquals="groupType(#group)">definition</span> group and
        <span concordion:assertTrue="groupIsEmpty(#group)">is empty</span>.</p>
        
        <p concordion:execute="addUserToGroup(#username, #group)">When we try to add the user
        <span concordion:set="#username">sebas</span>, the operation fails.</p>
        
        <p>Then the group <span concordion:assertTrue="groupIsEmpty(#group)">is still empty</span>.</p>
    </div>
