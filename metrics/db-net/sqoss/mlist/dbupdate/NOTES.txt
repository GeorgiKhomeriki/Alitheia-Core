1/ When changing the name of a table in the SQL source file, make sure you also change the
(corresponding) name "TABNAME" in the  "new SourceParser().createTableInsert(TABNAME);"
declarations - for example in the MailInserter class

2/ BE CAREFUL when using the Jangada framework... The signature extraction sometimes 
method either hangs or something else as soon it gets an attachment as input.
