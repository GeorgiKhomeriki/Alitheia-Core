/**
 * A ProjectRevision denotes a revision of a (any) project; revisions
 * may be created from dates or from SVN revision numbers. A specific
 * ProjectRevision object contains @em only dates or revisions; it is
 * not of itself associated with a specific project. If a ProjectRevision
 * is created with a date it has no SVN revision until it is applied to
 * a specific project; at that point its SVN revision @em may be set
 * by querying the SVN repository. Similarly ProjectRevisions created
 * from a specific revision number have no date until they hit a repository.
 *
 * ProjectRevisions are passed to many functions of the raw accessor
 * classes. It may be invalid to pass certain kinds of revisions
 * to some of those methods (for instance, the email accessors only
 * make sense if there is a date attached to the revision). The
 * InvalidProjectRevisionException is used to indicate problems like that.
