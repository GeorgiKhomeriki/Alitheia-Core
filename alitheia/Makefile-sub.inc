# This is a GNU Makefile

# This Makefile is part of the Alitheia system produced by the SQO-OSS
# consortium and is covered by the same LICENSE as the rest of the system:
# the 2-Clause FreeBSD license which you may find in the LICENSE file.

# This Makefile builds OSGi bundles in a straightforward fashion. It
# has none of the sophistication of the Maven setup in that it doesn't
# check for updates, downloads nothing, ignores other installed files,
# and doesn't handle multiple concurrent versions of the build. Some people
# consider this a feature. To use it, *include* it from a subdirectory.
# Before including, you should set two variables:
#
# 	BUNDLE_NAME	The name of the bundle itself, probably derived
#			from the directory name or the classes in the bundle.
#	BUNDLE_VERSION	The version number of the bundle; this should match
#			what is in the manifest and is appended to the
#			name of the jar file.
#
# Targets build, install and clean are defined.

# Extra dependencies for this bundle. These should point to the sources
# of other bundles. Everyone depends on the logger, so add it always.
EXTRA_CP+=:../core/src

# Optionally, the manifest name may be different from the bundle name.
# This is a historical mistake, but not easy to correct.
BUNDLE_MANIFEST_NAME?=$(BUNDLE_NAME)

# Namespace to prefix to jar names.
NAMESPACE=eu.sqooss.service

# END OF USER CONFIGURATION
