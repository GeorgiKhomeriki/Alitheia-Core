<p>The Fat Data Service (FDS) provides access to the data stored
in an Alitheia system. This is the <em>preprocessed</em> and <em>cached</em>
data on the projects that the system analyses. The FDS makes use of the
Thin Data Service (TDS) for all raw data access when the system does
not have a preprocessed and cached version of the data available.
</p>

<p>
The most important interface provided by the FDS is the Checkout.
This allows metrics (or other system components) to retrieve a
working copy (SVN checkout) of a project.
Checkouts are shared between system components and must be released
after use and must <em>not</em> be modified by system code.
