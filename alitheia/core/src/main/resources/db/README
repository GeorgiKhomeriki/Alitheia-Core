In this directory, you can put scipts that will be run automatically 
while the database is initializing. The scripts are mainly used to create
stored procedures and indexes in addition to those created by hibernate.
The files must follow the following naming convention and always come in
pairs, one for creating and one for dropping the database object:
 
	<objecttype>.<action>.<objectname>.<db>.sql

where

objecttype: one of {proc, idx, const}
action: one of {create, drop} 
name: the name of the object, string without spaces
db: the name of the DBMS this object works with, currently on of {mysql, postgres}

for example the file
   proc.create.updatelivefiles.mysql.sql

defines the create script of a stored procedure that only works with mysql.
