<body>
<p>The Fat Data Service (FDS) provides access to the data stored
in an Alitheia system. This is the <em>preprocessed</em> and <em>cached</em>
data on the projects that the system analyses. The FDS makes use of the
Thin Data Service (TDS) for all raw data access when the system does
not have a preprocessed and cached version of the data available.
</p>

<p>
Besides providing the CheckoutImpl which handles checkouts of
individual projects, the FDS also has a small set of disk utilities
(TODO: move to SQO Utils) for cleanup purposes.
