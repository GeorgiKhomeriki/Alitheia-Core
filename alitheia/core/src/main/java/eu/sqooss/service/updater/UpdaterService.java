/**
 * The updater service is the gateway in Alitheia to tell the system that the
 * raw data available to the system has changed; usually this means new source
 * code revisions, new email messages or new bug reports. Updating the metadata
 * is a two stage process: in the first stage, raw data is parsed and inserted
 * into the database while in the second stage the metadata is examined to infer
 * relationships between them.
 * 
 * The updater service acts as a registry of available updaters and knows what
 * updater to call based on the underlying metadata. The service is registration
 * based, so interested plug-ins must register {@link MetadataUpdater}
 * implementations for a set of protocols that the updater is capable of
 * processing. The protocol descriptions must match those exported to the
 * {@link TDSService}.
 * 
 * The updater service can be triggered either through this interface or via a
 * URL. The URL supported by the updater service lives underneath the web
 * administration site (which is localhost:8088 in the default Alitheia
 * installation) as /updater. Which data is updated depends on the value of the
 * GET parameter target; the project name is passed as GET parameter project.
 * The acceptable values of target are taken from the UpdateTarget enum. Sample
 * updater URLs are:
 * 
 * http://localhost:8088/updater?target=ALL&project=kde
 * http://localhost:8088/updater?target=code&project=postgres
 * 
 * Note that target values are not case-sensitive (but they must match the enum
 * names exactly).
