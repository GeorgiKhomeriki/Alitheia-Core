/**
 * The updater service is the gateway in Alitheia to tell the system
 * that the raw data available to the system has changed; usually this
 * means new source code revisions, new email messages or new bug reports.
 * The updater offers an HTTP interface to prompt the system. The URL
 * supported by the updater service lives underneath the web administration
 * site (which is localhost:8088 in the default Alitheia installation)
 * as /updater. Which data is updated depends on the value of the GET
 * parameter target; the project name is passed as GET parameter project.
 * The acceptable values of target are taken from the UpdateTarget enum.
 * Sample updater URLs are:
 *
 *  http://localhost:8088/updater?target=ALL&project=kde
 *  http://localhost:8088/updater?target=code&project=postgres
 *
 * Note that target values are not case-sensitive (but they must match the
 * enum names exactly).
 *
 * The rest of the interface contains implementation parts which typically
 * won't be called from code; it would be unusual for an internal part
 * of the system to call the updater, as it is intended as a way to poke
 * the system from the outside.
