 * The core administration service. The purpose of the service is to 
 * encapsulate common administrative actions (e.g. add a project, 
 * trigger an update) that result from user input to the system as 
 * a set of reusable components for use by other administrative
 * services (e.g. the updater, webadmin and cluster services). 
 * <br>
 * The administration service is not available to metric plug-ins.
 * 
 * <h3>Action implementation notes</h3>
 * By convention, all administrative action implementations:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>expect an open database session </li>
 *   <li>inherit from {@link ActionBase}</li>
 *   <li>Use the {@link AdminActionError} enumeration to register 
 *   all error messages that they return.</li>
