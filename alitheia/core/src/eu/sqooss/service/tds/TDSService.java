/**
 * The TDS service interface provides a way to retrieve and release
 * and configure the thin data access objects. A typical lifecycle
 * is as follows:
 *
 * - Check if there already is an accessor (optional); if there isn't
 *   this indicated that the project has not been requested recently.
 * - Request an accessor for the project. This may return null to inform
 *   that the project does not exist.
 * - If the accessor is returned, use its interface to get information
 *   from the project.
 * - When done, release the accessor.
 *
 * The accessor pool is limited by available connections and threads for
 * pulling information out of the file store, so do remember to free
 * accessors once you are done.
