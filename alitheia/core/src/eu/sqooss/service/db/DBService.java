/**
 * This is the service providing access to the Alitheia Database,
 * including project metadata, user management, metrics data...
 * 
 * The API includes methods for retrieving objects by id or by properties,
 * adding/updating/deleting records from the database,
 * and general-purpose querying methods for lower-level database access.
 * 
 * There are two overloads for each method: one with a Session argument and one without.
 * The methods without a Session argument manage the Hibernate session and transaction
 * for the operation internally, together with exception handling. This makes them
 * convenient to use for most cases, such as one-time queries or operations.
 * On the other hand, the methods with the Session argument delegate Hibernate session
 * and transaction management to the caller, as well as exception handling. This brings
 * greater flexibility, such as support for multiple operations within a same transaction,
 * but it requires the caller to write more code and is more prone to errors,
 * so you should only use them if you have a specific need for them.
 * 
 * Regardless of their type, the methods from this interface will log all errors
 * coming from Hibernate itself or from JDBC
