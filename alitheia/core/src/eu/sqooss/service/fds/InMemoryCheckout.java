/**
 * A checkout represents a working copy (checkout) of a project;
 * the InMemoryCheckout does not reside on disk but represents
 * the checkout as a collection of Java objects which may be read
 * through the usual InputStream methods. A checkout
 * has a specific revision attached to it. On no account may you edit
 * files in a checkout! It is a read only working copy. Other parts
 * of the Alitheia system may access the same checkout concurrently.
 * Use the FDSService to obtain a checkout and remember to release it
 * when done.
 *
 * Typical use of an in-memory checkout looks like this:
 *
 * <code>
 * Checkout c = fds.getCheckout(projectId, new ProjectRevision(svnRevision));
 * InMemoryDirectory d = c.getRoot();
 * // Do stuff in the file system tree under r, but don't change anything!
 * fds.releaseCheckout(c);
 * </code>
 *
 * A checkout carries with it knowledge of which revision it is, and you
 * can get the project Id with getId(), but there is no direct access to
 * the SCMAccessor that created the checkout -- you need to go through
 * the TDS or FDS again for that. The checkout also has the commit log
 * entry for itself, ie. svn log of getRevision().
 *
