/**
 * Common metric plug-in related functionality. Must be implemented
 * by all metrics plug-ins. There are four areas of functionality covered
 * by this interface: metric metadata (about the metric itself),
 * measurement (applying the metric to something), lifecycle (installation
 * and removal) and configuration (of the metric, for future measurements).
 *
 * The metric metadata comprises name, description, author information
 * and dates installed; this is static in the metric.
 *
 * Measurement comprises two methods: run which actually performs a measure-
 * ment on some project artifact (which one depends on the type of DAObject
 * which is passed in) and getResult which returns the value obtained
 * by a previous measurement.
 *
 * Lifecycle management is done through three verbs: install, remove and
 * update. These do what is on the box and should modify the database
 * schemas as appropriate.
 *
 * Finally, configuration management is for settings that each plugin
 * may have. These are (name,type) and (name,value) pairs; the former
 * is the configuration schema, the latter the values in that schema.
 *
 * All metrics are bound to one or more of the following
 * project entities:
 *
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Project</li>
 *  <li>Project Version</li>
 *  <li>File Group</li>
 *  <li>File</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * As a result, all metric implementations need to implement at least 2 interfaces:
 *
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>This interface</li>
 *      <li>One or more of the following interfaces, depending on the type of
 *      the entity the metric is bound to</li>
 *      <ul>
 *          <li>{@link StoredProjectMetric}</li>
 *          <li>{@link ProjectVersionMetric}</li>
 *          <li>{@link ProjectFileMetric}</li>
 *          <li>{@link FileGroupMetric}</li>
 *      </ul>
 *  </ul>
